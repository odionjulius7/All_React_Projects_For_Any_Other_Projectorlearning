## making an API call to the omdb database to get movies we search from input

# and search for using an ID to get a particular item

## We are using a useFetch custom hook to search for both with id and search term(query) input

# using context api to pass the value to each child component

<!-- // useFetch hook accept a query paramter(i.e our search term) from the context api
// we passed the id we want to search for, to the useFetch hook to search the url endpoint with the id -->

# we use .env to store our API key
