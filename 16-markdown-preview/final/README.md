## we are getting the functionality of our markdown from https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown
# it has documentation on how to install and setup the necessary markdown

# this a web app that allows users to type in the textarea and get the equivalent html or reactjs output

### e.g like #hello world will output for us <h1> text, ## <h2> text etc...

# NOTE: you style every markdown you input to a better visual view, do that in anticipation of which markdown u want to input e.g ![image](https://markodenic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/undraw_version_control_re_mg66-e1621781281433.png) that means u can style this markdown image
# in style sheet as img {height: 20px}
# or [google](hhtps://www.google.com) this link can be designed (a { color: blue}) in style sheet
